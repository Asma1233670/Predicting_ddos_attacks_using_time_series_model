# Predicting DDOS Attacks using a LSTM Time Series model
## DDos Attacks:
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.

From a high level, a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam clogging up the highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.

## How to identify a DDoS attack:
The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is a site or service suddenly becoming slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes — such a legitimate spike in traffic — can create similar performance issues, further investigation is usually required. Traffic analytics tools can help you spot some of these telltale signs of a DDoS attack:

Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range
A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version
An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint
Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)
There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack.

## Project goal: Utilize LSTM-based time series modeling to predict DDoS attacks with the aim of enhancing early detection and proactive mitigation strategies.

## Dataset: 
The used training and validation data is available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aymenabb/ddos-evaluation-dataset-cic-ddos2019
Which is part of the CICDDoS2017 dataset, which is an academic dataset collected by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity using CICFlowMeterV3, specifically dedicated to detecting distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. This data was collected on July 7, 2017, between 3:30 and 5:30.
